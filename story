Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkeywho resided on a jamun tree, which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
